A well-known supermarket in the area that serves a diverse clientele is the Hypermarket Capstone Project, located in HSR, Bangalore. In order to improve convenience and adapt to changing consumer demands, Freshco launched a home delivery service in 2021. In order to guarantee smooth operations and maximize customer happiness, the store carefully kept an extensive transaction data sheet with order-level details.

Business Metrics: Completion rate : This refers to the rate at which orders are completed (Order successfully delivered / Total order placed). Customer Lifetime value : It refers to the total revenue generated per customer. Usually this number is defined across various time period such as 3 month LTV, 6 month LTV or 12 months LTV. However, you donâ€™t need to consider specific time period for this business case. For example, if a person placed 15 orders and paid cumulative 4500 rupees to Freshco, the LTV for the customer is 4500 (excluding discount). Acquisition month: The first month in which the customer makes a purchase. For instance, you become a customer of Amazon in January 2017 if you placed your first buy there on January 15, 2017.

The acquisition month for a user remains constant and does not change with future transactions, similar to how your birth date is fixed. Delivery Area refers to the designated location where a product or package is to be delivered. For details, refer to the "order geo drop" column. Slot Definition: A time slot is a specific interval chosen by a customer to place an order from a particular store or location. Common time slots include: Morning: Orders placed between 5 AM and 12 PM Afternoon: Orders placed between 12 PM and 5 PM Evening: Orders placed between 5 PM and 8 PM Night: Orders placed between 8 PM and 11 PM Late Night: Orders placed between 11 PM and 5 AM
